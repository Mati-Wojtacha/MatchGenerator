    "content":"The main goal of the application is to generate a match schedule in such a way as to divide all participants into two groups and then create a list that will ensure that none of the possible combinations of pairs will be repeated. The application also offers the function of generating rematches for each group, which allows for more complete competition. Users can enter the results of individual matches, which allows them to create a clear summary showing the number of wins and losses for each player.",
