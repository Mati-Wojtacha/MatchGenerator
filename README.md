# TeamAllocation

TeamAllocation is a straightforward application that divides people into two teams, ensuring that each person plays against another exactly once, creating a unique match for every individual. In addition to this core functionality, it offers the following features:

1. Rematches: The application allows you to create rematches for all matches. This ensures that players can face each other again in subsequent rounds.
2. Removal of Individual Rematch Objects: You can remove specific rematch objects if needed. This flexibility allows you to manage the rematch process effectively.
3. PDF Generation: TeamAllocation provides the capability to generate PDF files containing all match details. These files include information about every game played.
